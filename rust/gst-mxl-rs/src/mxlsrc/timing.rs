//! MXL index ↔ GStreamer PTS mapping for `mxlsrc` discrete (video, data) flows.
//!
//! `mxlsink` commits each grain at an **absolute** MXL grain index derived from
//! its PTS via the MXL media clock (`timestamp_to_index`). The same source
//! frame therefore lands at the *same* absolute index on every flow it is
//! written to (e.g. the video flow and its companion ancillary data flow).
//!
//! Readers exploit this: PTS is computed purely from the absolute index of the
//! grain actually read (`pts_for_index`), minus the MXL-time →
//! running-time subtrahend `pts_subtrahend` (the pipeline-shared offset `D`
//! plus the live pipeline `base_time`). Because every MXL element in the pipeline
//! shares one `D` (see `crate::clock::SharedClockOffset`), two `mxlsrc`
//! instances reading the same absolute grain expose identical PTS regardless of
//! when each attached or how far either fell behind — which is what
//! `st2038combiner` needs to re-pair video with its ancillary data, for example
//! — while the PTS still lands in the pipeline's running-time base so live
//! elements can synchronise the flows against the pipeline clock.
