# Architecture

The MXL library provides a mechanism for sharing ring buffers of Flow and Grains (see NMOS IS-04 definitions) between media functions executing on the same host (bare-metal or containerized) and/or between media functions executing on hosts connected using fast fabric technologies (RDMA, EFA, etc).

The MXL library provides APIs for zero-overhead grain _sharing_ using a reader/writer model in opposition to a sender/receiver model. With a reader/writer model, no packetization or even memory copy is involved, preserving memory bandwidth and CPU cycles.

## Shared memory model

Flows and Grains are _ring buffers_ stored in memory mapped files written in a _tmpfs_ backed volume or filesystem. The base folder where flows are stored is called an _MXL domain_. Multiple MXL domains can co-exist on the same host.

### Filesystem layout

| Path                                                    | Description                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \${mxlDomain}/                                          | Base directory of the MXL domain                                                                                              |

| \${mxlDomain}/\${flowId}.mxl-flow/data                  | Flow header. contains metadata for a flow ring buffer. Memory mapped by readers and writers.                                  |
| \${mxlDomain}/\${flowId}.mxl-flow/flow_def.json         | NMOS IS-04 Flow resource definition.                                                                                          |
| \${mxlDomain}/\${flowId}.mxl-flow/access                | File 'touched' by readers (if permissions allow it) to notify flow access. Enables reliable 'lastReadTime' metadata update.   |
| \${mxlDomain}/\${flowId}.mxl-flow/grains/               | Directory where individual grains are stored.                                                                                 |
| \${mxlDomain}/\${flowId}.mxl-flow/grains/\${grainIndex} | Grain Header and optional payload (if payload is in host memory and not device memory ). Memory mapped by readers and writers |

### Note

- FlowWriters will obtain a SHARED advisory lock on any memory mapped files (data and grains) and hold it until closed. This is used to detect stale flows in the _mxlGarbageCollectFlows()_ function (for example, when a crashed media function failed to release the flow properly)

## Security model

### UNIX permissions

The MXL SDK uses UNIX files and directories, allowing it to leverage operating system file permissions (users, groups, etc) not only at the mxl domain level but also at the individual flow level.

### IPC and Process namespaces

The memory mapping model used by MXL does not require a shared IPC or process namespace, making it suitable for safe use in containerized environments.

### Memory Mapping

An _mxlFlowReader_ will only _mmap_ flow resources in readonly mode (PROT_READ), allowing readers to access flows stored in a readonly volume or filesystem. In order to support this use case, synchronization between readers and writers is performed using futexes and not using POSIX mutexes, which would require write access to the mutex stored in shared memory.

## Timing model

See [timing model](./Timing.md)

## Ring buffer types 

The MXL SDK provides two ringbuffer types: Discrete and Continuous.  Discrete ringbuffers are used for granular data types such as video and ancillary data.  Continuous ringbuffers are used for audio. 

### Ring buffer access model

Continuous: the tail half of the ring buffer is reserved for the writer, and readers can access the remaining half.

Discrete: the tail entry of the ring buffer is reserved for the writer, and readers can access the remaining entries.

## Discrete Grain I/O

Grain I/O can be 'partial'. In other words, a FlowWriter can write the bytes of a grain progressively (as slices for example).

The following example demonstrates how a FlowWriter may write a grain as slices using multiple `mxlFlowWriterCommitGrain()` calls. The important field here is the mxlGrainInfo.committedSize: it tells us how many bytes in the grain are valid. A complete grain will have `mxlGrainInfo.committedSize == mxlGrainInfo.grainSize`. It is imperative that FlowReaders _always_ take into consideration the `mxlGrainInfo.committedSize` field before making use of the grain buffer. The `mxlFlowReaderGetGrain` function will return as soon as new data is committed to the grain.

### Example Grain I/O (from the [unit tests](../lib/tests/test_flows.cpp))

```c++
    ///
    /// Write and read a grain in 8 slices
    ///

    /// Open the grain.
    mxlGrainInfo gInfo;
    uint8_t *buffer = nullptr;

    /// Open the grain for writing.
    REQUIRE( mxlFlowWriterOpenGrain( instanceWriter, writer, index, &gInfo, &buffer ) == MXL_STATUS_OK );

    const size_t maxSlice = 8;
    auto sliceSize = gInfo.grainSize / maxSlice;
    for ( size_t slice = 0; slice < maxSlice; slice++ )
    {
        /// Write a slice the grain.
        gInfo.committedSize += sliceSize;
        REQUIRE( mxlFlowWriterCommitGrain( instanceWriter, writer, &gInfo ) == MXL_STATUS_OK );

        mxlFlowRuntimeInfo sliceFlowRuntimeInfo;
        REQUIRE( mxlFlowReaderGetRuntimeInfo( instanceReader, reader, &sliceFlowRuntimeInfo ) == MXL_STATUS_OK );
        REQUIRE( sliceFlowRuntimeInfo.headIndex == index );

        /// Read back the partial grain using the flow reader.
        REQUIRE( mxlFlowReaderGetGrain( instanceReader, reader, index, 8, &gInfo, &buffer ) == MXL_STATUS_OK );

        // Validate the committed size
        REQUIRE( gInfo.committedSize == sliceSize * ( slice + 1 ) );
    }
```

## Continuous Ringbuffer I/O

### `mxlContinuousFlowConfigInfo` in context

`mxlFlowReaderGetInfo`, `mxlFlowReaderGetConfigInfo`, `mxlFlowWriterGetInfo`, and `mxlFlowWriterGetConfigInfo` all return a full `mxlFlowInfo` copy
that combines immutable configuration (`mxlFlowConfigInfo`) and mutable runtime (`mxlFlowRuntimeInfo`). For a continuous flow the layout inside the
config union is:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `channelCount` | `uint32_t` | Number of de-interleaved channel ring buffers allocated for the flow. |
| `bufferLength` | `uint32_t` | Number of sample slots in **each** channel buffer. Readers and writers may only access windows shorter than half of this. |
| `reserved` | `uint8_t[56]` | Zeroed padding so the structure remains 64 bytes wide. |

The `common` block that precedes the `continuous` block contributes additional information that every continuous reader needs:

- `grainRate` carries the sample rate (numerator/denominator rational).
- `format` encodes the payload format (`audio/float32`) so you know the sample word size.
- `maxCommitBatchSizeHint` / `maxSyncBatchSizeHint` advertise how many samples are written in one go. Staying within those hints keeps the reader from spinning on the futex that controls `flow->state.syncCounter`.
- `payloadLocation` and `deviceIndex` tell you if the samples sit in host RAM or device memory.

```c
mxlFlowInfo info = {};
MXL_THROW_IF_FAILED(mxlFlowReaderGetInfo(reader, &info));

const mxlContinuousFlowConfigInfo *continuous = &info.config.continuous;
const uint32_t channelCount = continuous->channelCount;
const uint32_t channelBufferLength = continuous->bufferLength;
const mxlRational sampleRate = info.config.common.grainRate;
// sampleRate == samples per second for continuous flows
```

### Memory layout of continuous flow info

The flow metadata file `${mxlDomain}/${flowId}.mxl-flow/data` contains a single `mxlFlowInfo` object with the following organization:

```
Offset  Size  Description
0x0000  0x04  version (currently 1)
0x0004  0x04  size (must stay 2048)
0x0008  0x80  mxlCommonFlowConfigInfo  (ID, format, rate, batch hints, payload info)
0x0088  0x40  mxlContinuousFlowConfigInfo (channelCount, bufferLength, reserved)
0x00C8  0x40  mxlFlowRuntimeInfo (headIndex, lastWriteTime, lastReadTime, reserved)
0x0108  0x6F8 reserved padding to keep the struct cache-line aligned
```

The actual audio samples do **not** live in `data`. They are stored in `${mxlDomain}/${flowId}.mxl-flow/channels`, a shared memory blob that is
exactly `channelCount * bufferLength * sampleWordSize` bytes long. The layout of this blob is:

```
channel 0 buffer (bufferLength * sampleWordSize bytes)
channel 1 buffer (bufferLength * sampleWordSize bytes)
...
channel N-1 buffer
```

Each channel buffer behaves like a classic circular buffer. The reader and writer API expose this geometry through `mxlWrappedMultiBufferSlice`. The
type inherits the same ideas as the slice documentation referenced above: `base.fragments[0]` and `base.fragments[1]` capture the two contiguous
fragments (slices) you need when a request straddles the wrap-around point, and `stride` spans the gap between channels. When the sample window is
fully contained inside the ring, `fragments[1].size` is simply zero.

### Accessing samples

Reading a window of samples requires three pieces of information:

1. The desired absolute sample index (`index`). This is the last sample you want to include.
2. The number of samples to look backwards by (`count`). This must not exceed `bufferLength / 2`.
3. The timeout you are willing to wait for the window (`timeoutNs`).

`mxlFlowReaderGetSamples` and `mxlFlowReaderGetSamplesNonBlocking` fill an `mxlWrappedMultiBufferSlice` that points into the channel buffer blob.
`payloadBuffersSlices.stride` is the distance (in bytes) between two channels, and `payloadBuffersSlices.count` repeats the slice geometry once per
channel. The pseudocode below shows how to consume `audio/float32` samples while respecting the fragments and stride:

```c
// Read the latest 256 samples per channel, waiting up to 5 ms.
mxlWrappedMultiBufferSlice slices;
mxlFlowRuntimeInfo runtime;
mxlFlowReaderGetRuntimeInfo(reader, &runtime);

uint64_t const lastSample = runtime.headIndex;
size_t const windowLength = 256;
mxlFlowReaderGetSamples(
    reader,
    lastSample,
    windowLength,
    5'000'000,  // 5 milliseconds
    &slices);

size_t const channels = slices.count;
size_t const strideBytes = slices.stride;
size_t const fragment0Samples = slices.base.fragments[0].size / sizeof(float);
size_t const fragment1Samples = slices.base.fragments[1].size / sizeof(float);

for (size_t channel = 0; channel < channels; ++channel)
{
    size_t const channelOffset = channel * strideBytes;
    uint8_t const* const channelBase0 = (uint8_t const*)(slices.base.fragments[0].pointer) + channelOffset;
    uint8_t const* const channelBase1 = (uint8_t const*)(slices.base.fragments[1].pointer) + channelOffset;

    float const* const firstSlice = (float const*)(channelBase0);
    float const* const secondSlice = (float const*s)(channelBase1);

    // Process the first fragment (may already contain the entire window).
    for (size_t i = 0; i < fragment0Samples; ++i)
    {
        consume_sample(channel, firstSlice[i]);
    }

    // Only needed when the window wrapped around the ring buffer.
    for (size_t i = 0; i < fragment1Samples; ++i)
    {
        consume_sample(channel, secondSlice[i]);
    }
}
```

Writing samples mirrors the same pattern but uses `mxlMutableWrappedMultiBufferSlice`:

```c
mxlMutableWrappedMultiBufferSlice scratch;
mxlFlowWriterOpenSamples(writer, nextSampleIndex, batchSize, &scratch);
// Fill scratch for every channel respecting fragments and stride, exactly like the reader example.
// ...
mxlFlowWriterCommitSamples(writer);
```

A few important rules fall straight out of the data structure:

- Readers can only observe up to `bufferLength / 2` samples in one call. The other half of the buffer is considered “write in progress”, which prevents races when a writer is wrapping around.
- `index` is inclusive: asking for `(headIndex, 256)` returns samples `headIndex - 255` through `headIndex`.
- Never assume the sample window is contiguous. Instead always treat the window as two contiguous slices, that may or may not be empty (i.e. have a `size` of `0`).
- Continuous flows ride on the same slice/fragment helpers as discrete flows. `fragments[0]` and `fragments[1]` are slices of bytes, and `stride`
  identifies how far you have to slide (hence “stride”) to reach the same sample in the next channel.

# Aligned Processing of Multiple Flows

Media functions oftentimes have the requirement to consume multiple, time aligned flows concurrently. In order to
facilitate this use case MXL offers *Flow Synchronization Groups* that allow synchronizing on data availability across
multiple flows.

A *Flow Synchronization Group* is set up by creating it and adding one or more readers to it, by calling either
* `mxlFlowSynchronizationGroupAddReader()` if the reader operates on a continuous flow or the reader operates on
    a discrete flow and the intention is to consume entire grains, or
* `mxlFlowSynchronizationGroupAddPartialGrainReader()` if the reader operates on a discrete flow and the intention is to
    consume partial grains, for which a specified number of slices has to be available at the time of synchronization.

Once a *Flow Synchronization Group* is set up clients can synchronize on grain(slice)s or samples corresponding to a
specified time stamp to become available by calling `mxlFlowSynchronizationGroupWaitForDataAt()`.

Please note that the choice has been made to synchronize on timestamps rather than indices, because the former
identifies a specific head index across all flows that are part of a group, while the latter would only be valid with
regards to one specific grain/sample rate.

A media function consuming multiple flows should define a nominal output rate from which it can derive the time stamps
to synchronize on, like so:

```c
// Assume the following variables to be initialized out of the scope of this code section
mxlRational outputRate = ...;
uint64_t nextIndex = ...;

// ...

uint64_t const nextTimestamp = mxlIndexToTimestamp(&outputRate, nextIndex);
```

Then the processing loop consuming multiple flows tracked by a *Flow Synchronization Group* can look like this:

```c
// Assume the following variables to be initialized out of the scope of this code section
mxlFlowSynchronizationGroup inputFlowSyncGroup = ...;

mxlRational outputRate = ...;
uint64_t nextIndex = ...;

while (running)
{
    // Wait 5ms for the corresponding indices to become available
    uint64_t const nextTimestamp = mxlIndexToTimestamp(&outputRate, nextIndex);
    mxlStatus waitResult = mxlFlowSynchronizationGroupWaitForDataAt(inputFlowSyncGroup, nextTimestamp, 5'000'000);
    if (waitResult == MXL_STATUS_OK)
    {
        // For each input flow consume the grains/samples at or up until
        // mxlTimestampToIndex(&inputFlowRate, nextTimestamp)
        // ...
    }
}
```

# Grain formats

## Video

Video grains can be of two different formats: video/v210 for video without transparency and video/v210a for fill and key signals (video with alpha transparency).

### video/v210

The `video/v210` format is an uncompressed buffer format carrying 10 bit 4:2:2 video. A detailed description of the format can be found [here](https://wiki.multimedia.cx/index.php/V210) and [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2162/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40013070-CH1-TNTAG8-V210__4_2_2_COMPRESSION_TYPE).

### video/v210a (v210 + alpha)

The `video/v210a` format contains both fill and key inside a single grain.  The fill part starts at byte 0 of the grain and follows the v210 definition above. The key buffer is found immediately after the fill buffer.  Samples are organized in blocks of 32 bit values in little-endian.  Each block contains 3 luma samples, one each in bits 0 - 9, 10 - 19 and 20 - 29, the remaining two bits are unused.  The start of each line is aligned to a multiple of 4 bytes, where unused blocks are padded with 0.  The last block of a line might have more padding than just the last 2 bits if the width is not divisible by 3.  For example, 1280x720 resolution has padding for bits 20 to 31 on the last block.

Alpha samples are 'straight' (not premultiplied) and follow the same data range as the fill.  For example, if the fill is _video range_ (64 to 960) then the samples of the key are also _video range_.

```

- Width: 1280 pixels
- Blocks per line: ⌈1280/3⌉ = 427 blocks
- Last block: 1 pixel luma sample + zero padding in bits 10-31


Key points:
• Fill buffer (v210) comes first, followed immediately by key buffer (alpha)
• Each 32-bit block contains 3 luma samples (10 bits each)
• Lines are 4-byte aligned with zero padding
```

## Audio

### audio/float32

The `audio/float32` format has audio stored as 32 bit [IEEE 754](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/754/6210/) float values with a full-scale range of \[−1.0 ; +1.0]\. This is the same audio representation as in RIFF/WAV files with `<wFormatTag>` `0x0003` `WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT`.

Please note that flow producing media functions are not required to stay within the full-scale range and *should not* artificially clamp values to that range. Instead flow consuming media functions that are sensitive to levels exceeding 0 dbFS should, as a fail-safe measure clamp the sample values read to the supported range. This gives operators increased freedom in architecting their processing pipelines and retaining maximum fidelity.

## Ancillary Data

The `video/smpte291` format is an ancillary data payload based on [RFC 8331](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8331#section-2).   Only the bytes starting at the *Length* field (See section 2 of RFC 8331) are stored in the grain (bytes 0 to 13 are redundant in the context of MXL and are not stored).
